# GDMS-Final-Project-
Our Team is with GDMS for ASU Capstone Project for GUI Test Process Development. This is our finalsubmission repository, where we demonstrate the testing of a demo application on a virtual machine environment and subsequently deploy and test it on physical boards. The project focuses on automating GUI testing using tools like Squish and Qtqml apps.
